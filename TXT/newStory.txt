There
was
once
the
son
of
a
frog
RINRIN
Tadpole
One
morning
he
went
out
very
stiffly
and
very
pretty.
He
was
in
shorts
and
a
fashion
tie
With
a
nice
wedding
HAT
and
fancy
vest
on
it
“My
son
please
don’t
go,”
mom
yells,
But
he
very
smugly
suddenly
leaves.

By
the
road
RINRIN
found
a
mouse,
And
he
said,
“My
friend
you
should
come
with
me,
We
can
visit
Mrs.
Mouse
and
have
a
feast”

The
little
mouse
and
RINRIN
arrived
at
Mrs.
Mouse's
house
And
very
elegantly
the
little
mouse
knocked
on
the
door
at
once
After
two
or
three
knocks,
Mrs.
Mouse
asks,
“Who
is
it?”
“Me
Mrs.
Mouse,
kiss
your
feet!”

They
say
hi
to
each
other
while
hanging
their
hands
And
suddenly
the
little
mouse
said,
“Mrs.
Mouse,
my
little
friend
needs
something
to
drink,
Please
give
him
a
beer
and
let's
start
to
drink”

While
the
little
mouse
was
drinking
the
beer
And
asking
Mrs.
Mouse
to
bring
something
to
sing
The
pretty
RINRIN
was
enjoying
this
time
With
some
good
drinks
and
nice
MUSIC
to
hear.

Although
the
party
was
fun
for
all
With
DANCING,
drinking
and
a
beautiful
song
Suddenly
Mom
CAT
and
her
kitties
arrived
at
Mrs.
Mouse's
place
And
this
wonderful
party
finally
ends.

Mom
cat
hooked
the
little
mouse's
ear
And
with
her
terrific
voice
just
said
“hi”
The
little
kitten
caught
Mrs.
Mouse
Once
by
the
tail
and
once
at
the
foot

The
little
RINRIN
the
walker
tadpole
Took
his
HAT
and
suddenly
ran,
And
quickly
said
good
bye
to
all

RINRIN
the
tadpole
was
jumping
so
fast
That
he
tore
his
vest
and
lost
his
HAT
He
lost
himself
and
while
he
was
turning
around
A
hungry
big
duck
suddenly
ate
the
little
tadpole

And
that
how
it
ends,
one,
two
and
three,
little
mouse,
Mrs.
Mouse
and
RINRIN
the
tadpole;
The
cats
ate
and
the
duck
too
And
finally
the
poor
little
Mom
frog,
remained
alone.
